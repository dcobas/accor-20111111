\section{The fate of \texttt{drivers.xml}}

\begin{frame}{Driver installation process}
In a typical VME driver scenario, a driver needs some information from
user space to locate devices and initialize.

The configuration description for the crate is in the CCDB and is
extracted into a \url{transfer.ref} file by a program called
\url{dscinit}

This way, a device driver knows the parameters (base addresses,
interrupt vectors, etc.) for each of the devices it has to manage
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The file \url{drivers.xml}}

A parallel mechanism for passing this information was proposed
(beginning 2009?) to completely describe the hardware layout of a crate

It turned out to have many disadvantages

\begin{itemize}
\item inconsistencies between \url{transfer.ref} and \url{drivers.xml}
\item incomplete representation of information
\item need to embed an XML parser in the driver load process
\item (mis)implementation of a complicated installation procedure
\item introduction of superfluous dependencies
\item \url{nmn} was right
\end{itemize}

As a consequence, the use of the \url{drivers.xml} mechanism is
deprecated and will be migrated to a \url{transfer.ref}-based
mechanism by Q1 2012.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Discontinuation sequence for \url{drivers.xml}}

\begin{description}
\item[Jan 2012] Removal of XML-based load mechanism in CTRV, therefore
	in all CTR drivers
\item[Feb 2012] Full move to \url{transfer.ref}-based mechanism
	for Skel-based, Linux drivers (CVORG, MTT, XMEM, VD80)
\item[Apr 2012] Removal of XML-based load mechanism for Skel-based,
	LynxOS drivers (the same)
\end{description}

From that point on, all driver installations will be based on
information extracted via \url{transfer.ref}
